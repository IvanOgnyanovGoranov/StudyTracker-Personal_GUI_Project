# StudyTracker-Personal_GUI_Project

Overview
The Study Tracker is a simple time-tracking app built with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to track study sessions for various subjects, set daily study goals, and view progress over time. It also stores time and days spent studying on every subject, and displays the daily progress in percenatges. This project demonstrates fundamental programming skills, GUI development, and data management using CSV files.
